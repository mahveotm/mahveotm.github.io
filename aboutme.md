Hi. Welcome!

I'm Marvellous. My friends call me Mahveo, Mahveotm, tm or simply Marv. 

Currently, I work for a small health startup as an automation(Infastructure as Code) engineer. 

I am particularly interested in SysOps, Cloud architecture, Arts & Nigerian politics. 

I also volunteer with the Wikimedia project & genius.com (where I annotate music - mostly Afrobeats). 


Talk to me about anything. I have a particularly impressive range and just enjoy listening to people talk about what they're passionate about. 

See you around.
