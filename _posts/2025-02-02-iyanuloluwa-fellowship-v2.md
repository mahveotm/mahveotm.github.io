Hi everyone, 
announcing the second edition of the Iyanuloluwa Osuolale Fellowship, 
You can read about last year's edition [here](https://mahveotm.github.io/2024-01-14-in-rememberance/). 

Accepted applicants will be provided with resources and exam vouchers to prepare for, and take an AWS foundational/associate exam of their choice. 

The following resources will be provided if you're selected, 
 - An AWS exam voucher to take an AWS exam of your choosing, this covers the Foundational(Cloud Practioner, AI Practitioner), and the Associate(Solutions Architect, Developer, Sysops Administrator, Machine Learning Engineer, Data Engineer) path. 
 - Exam preparatory resources. These would include an AWS practice test and a preparatory course on Udemy. If you already have a resource you're using, you might not need this. 
 - There will also be about an hour session to discuss exam application, prep, processes, and all that. Most people might not find this useful, but a small subset might, based on feedback from the previous edition. 

 Adding as many resources as I can for this edition, to set as many people as I can for success. 

We aim to disburse the resources to successful applicants by the weekend of the second week of February.

 As an addendum, this is coming entirely out of the trust without sponsorship. I'd appreciate it if it goes to the exact people who might find them very useful. If you're not fully convinced you'd be needing these resources at the moment, please do not apply for them. 

If interested, please email me at m @ rvellous dot com, or send me a message on WhatsApp. 

Thanks. 

Marv, 

For the family.
