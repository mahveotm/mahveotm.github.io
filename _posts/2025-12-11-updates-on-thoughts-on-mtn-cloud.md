A couple of weeks ago, I shared my [thoughts on MTN Cloud](https://blog.mahveo.codes/2025-10-22-thoughts-on-mtn-cloud/), highlighting areas where I believe the platform needs to mature to truly compete with major players like AWS, Google Cloud and Azure. One of my primary critiques was the lack of visible support for **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**, specifically Terraform, which I argue is now a core part of modern cloud practice.

Earlier today, I attended a webinar with representatives from the MTN Cloud team, who confirmed that deploying cloud infrastructure through Terraform on MTN Cloud should indeed be possible.

While it is currently unclear exactly how to deploy Terraform providers against their customized OpenStack/Morpheus environment, this is very promising news. I'll be happy to tinker around with it once a decent documentation site is available showing the necessary steps.

Speaking of documentation, technical blogs, and knowledge sharing, another critical point in my original post, I specifically asked the team about it. They were transparent that, while a proper documentation site does not exist at the moment(which is why they're starting with a Webinar for knowledge sharing), it is high on their roadmap. They _said_ that we should have a detailed documentation website scheduled for release in Q1 of next year.

I think this is a good thing. This level of transparency and commitment to developer tools is part of what what MTN Cloud needs to drive adoption.

If anybody from MTN Cloud is reading this, that was great, we need more webinars. 

Thank you
